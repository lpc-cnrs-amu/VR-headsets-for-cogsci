# The project

The purpose of this article is to present a straightforward workflow suitable for **cognitive scientists** interested in using **virtual reality headsets**.
The workflow starts from the installation of third-party software (mainly the Unity engine) to the insertion of simple C# scripts that are able to collect data from the various available headset sensors. 
The proposed workflow, simple enough to be implemented within a few hours, can help scientists in many domains to achieve their first tests and experiments in the laboratory setting.

This guide makes use of the following Virtual Reality setup:

- one **DELL Precision desktop** (Intel Core i7 8700K processor, 6 cores at 3.7 Ghz; 16 GB of RAM) with a NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphic card. The monitor was standard.
- one **HTC Vive Pro** (cost: ~1000/1500 $). Beware of the location of the stores as product may vary from one place to the other.

The scientific programs created in this guide were successfully tested on both the HTC and the FOVE headsets. Chosen software is free-of-use.

# A practical guide

To help conceive and start a protocol, we present a workflow from software installation to the realization of a simple experiment.
