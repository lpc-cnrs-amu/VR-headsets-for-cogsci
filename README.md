This guide makes use of the following Virtual Reality setup:

- one **DELL Precision desktop** (Intel Core i7 8700K processor, 6 cores at 3.7 Ghz; 16 GB of RAM) with a NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphic card. The monitor was standard.
- one **HTC Vive Pro** (cost: ~1000/1500 $). Beware of the location of the stores as product may vary from one place to the other.

The scientific programs created in this guide were successfully tested on both the HTC and the FOVE headsets. Chosen software is free-of-use.
